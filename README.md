# Team Fortress 2 Server on ARM machine

This container wraps everything that needs to be installed to make a TF2 server works on an ARM machine. It uses [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) ([Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86) for steamcmd) to have the best emulation performances.

Credit goes to the developer of these containers ([CM2Walki](https://github.com/CM2Walki)) for laying the foundation upon which this container was built :
[x86_64 TF2 Container](https://github.com/CM2Walki/TF2)
[x86_64 Steamcmd](https://github.com/CM2Walki/steamcmd)
